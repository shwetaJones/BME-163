Hi Everybody,

 

As discussed in class, this week's assignment is going to be a little different.

Your goal will be to replicate the template below.

How exactly you do this is up to you. It will likely involve some combination of a vector graphics program like Inkscape, CorelDraw, or Adobe Illustrator (maybe even Photoshop!) and remaking your figures with different dimensions.

You have to use panels that your own scripts produce. If they aren't perfect, that's fine. You won't be scored on the content of the individual panels. Also, for the swarm plot figure, your subsampling and function might differ from mine, so when you add your legend insert, make sure not to cover up any points (you may have to move it, and that's fine)

 

Pay attention to line widths, font types and sizes, panel and label alignments.

 

Happy plotting!

SCORE: 100/100
