Hi Everybody,

 

Your goal for this assignment will be to replicate the template below. I will post a video on how to parse and plot psl files by Wednesday.

Final_Assignment_template.png 

For this figure, you'll have to parse one gtf file (gencode.vM12.annotation.gtf) for the top panel and two psl files for middle (BME163_Input_Data_5.psl) and bottom (BME163_Input_Data_6.psl) panel.

Coordinates for the gene locus are

 

chromosome: chr7
left: 45232945
right: 45240000

 

For each of the panel, transcripts/reads have to be plotted and stacked in a way that takes advantage of the available space efficiently. Try to match the way the template looks but as long as your read are packed well and look sorted in the bottom panel, you are good.

Figure width=10 inches

Figure height=5 inches

 

Panel heights= 1.25 inches

Panel width= 10 inches

 

Naming convention:

LastName_FirstName_BME163_Assignment_Final.py -i1 /location/of/BME163_Input_Data_5.psl -i2 /location/of/BME163_Input_Data_6.psl -g  /location/of/gencode.vM12.annotation.gtf -o name_of_output_file.png

 

Please submit your py file and a 1200 dpi image of your genome browser shot.

Happy plotting!
